pixabulb-OctoWS2811
===================

Driving a Pixabulb string from a Teensy 3.1 using the OctoWS2811 library

This project assumes you are running a Teensy 3.1 available from pjrc.com or Adafruit.
The OctoWS2811 library does the low level work, and this code adds some fun things to it
like candle glows, star twinkles, strobe effects, etc.
